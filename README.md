# Intent Recognition
This project is an intent recognition system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify the intent of a user's input. The system takes user input in the form of text and classifies it into one of several pre-defined categories, or "intents".
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Hamrah Aval questions dataset, which is about 4,400 questions in the Farsi language, with 11 pre-defined intents.

## Approach
The project will use a machine learning approach to recognize the intent of the sentence. The following steps will be taken:

- Data Preparation: The dataset will be preprocessed and cleaned to remove any noise and irrelevant information.
- Feature Extraction: The text data will be transformed into a numerical representation using word embeddings.
- Model Development: Fine-tuning BERT
- Model Evaluation: The model will be evaluated on a test set to measure its accuracy and other performance metrics.

## Requirements
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Transformers
